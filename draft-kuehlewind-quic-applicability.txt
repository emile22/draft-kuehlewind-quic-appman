1.  Introduction

   QUIC [I-D.ietf-quic-transport] is a new transport protocol currently
   under development in the IETF quic working group, focusing on support
   of semantics as needed for HTTP/2 [I-D.ietf-quic-http] such as
   stream-multiplexing to avoid head-of-line blocking.  Based on current
   deployment practices, QUIC is encapsulated in UDP and encrypted by
   default.  This means the version of QUIC that is currently under
   development will integrate TLS 1.3 [I-D.ietf-quic-tls] to encrypt all
   payload data and most header information.

   This document provides guidance for application developers that want
   to use the QUIC protocol without implementing it on their own.  This
   includes general guidance for application use of HTTP/2 over QUIC as
   well as the use of other application layer protocols over QUIC.  For
   specific guidance on how to integrate HTTP/2 with QUIC, see
   [I-D.ietf-quic-http].

   In the following ssections we discuss specific caveats to QUIC's
   applicability, and issues that application developers must consider
   when using QUIC as a transport for their application.

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", and "MAY" are used in this
   document.  It's not shouting; when these words are capitalized, they
   have a special meaning as defined in [RFC2119].

2.  The Necessity of Fallback

   QUIC uses UDP as a substrate for userspace implementation and port
   numbers for NAT and middlebox traversal.  While there is no evidence
   of widespread, systematic disadvantage of UDP traffic compared to TCP

   in the Internet [Edeline16], somewhere between three [Trammell16] and
   five [Swett16] percent of networks simply block UDP traffic.  All
   applications running on top of QUIC must therefore either be prepared
   to accept connectivity failure on such networks, or be engineered to
   fall back to some other transport protocol.  This fallback SHOULD
   provide TLS 1.3 or equivalent cryptographic protection, if available,
   in order to keep fallback from being exploited as a downgrade attack.
   In the case of HTTP, this fallback is TLS 1.3 over TCP.

   These applications must operate, perhaps with impaired functionality,
   in the absence of features provided by QUIC not present in the
   fallback protocol.  For fallback to TLS over TCP, the most obvious
   difference is that TCP does not stream multiplexing and there stream
   multiplex would need to be implemented in the application layer if
   needed.  Further, TCP by default does not support 0-RTT session
   resumption.  TCP Fast Open could be used, but might no be supported
   by the far end or could be blocked on the network path.  Note that
   there is some evidence of middleboxes blocking SYN data even if TFO
   was successfully negotiated (see [PaaschNanog]).  Moreover, while
   encryption (in this case TLS) is inseparable integrated with QUIC,
   TLS negotiation over TCP can be blocked.  In case it is RECOMMENDED
   to abort the connection, allowing the application to present a
   suitable prompt to the user that secure communication is unavailable.

   We hope that the deployment of a proposed standard version of the
   QUIC protocol will provide an incentive for these networks to permit
   QUIC traffic.  Indeed, the ability to treat QUIC traffic statefully
   as discussed in section XX of [draft-kuehlewind-quic-manageability]
   would remove one network management incentive to block this traffic.

3.  Zero RTT: Here There Be Dragons

   QUIC provides for 0-RTT connection establishment (see section 3.2 of
   [I-D.ietf-quic-transport]).  However, data in the frames contained in
   the first packet of a such a connection must be treated specially by
   the application layer.  Since a retransmission of these frames
   resulting from a lost acknowledgment may cause the data to appear
   twice, either the application-layer protocol has to be designed such
   that all such data is treated as idempotent, or there must be some
   application-layer mechanism for recognizing spuriously retransmitted
   frames and dropping them.

   Applications that cannot treat data that may appear in a 0-RTT
   connection establishment as idempotent MUST NOT use 0-RTT
   establishment.

4.  Stream versus Flow Multiplexing

   QUIC's stream multiplexing feature allows applications to run
   multiple streams over a single connection, without head-of-line
   blocking between streams, associated at a point in time with a single
   five-tuple.  Streams are meaningful only to the application; since
   stream information is carried inside QUIC's encryption boundary, no
   information about the stream(s) whose frames are carried by a given
   packet is visible to the network.

   Stream multiplexing is not intended to be used for differentiating
   streams in terms of network treatment.  Application traffic requiring
   different network treatment SHOULD therefore be carried over
   different five-tuples (i.e.  multiple QUIC connections).  Given
   QUIC's ability to send application data on the first packet of a
   connection (if a previous connection to the same host has been
   successfully established to provide the respective credentials), the
   cost for establishing another connection are extremely low.

   [EDITOR'S NOTE: For discussion: If establishing a new connection does
   not seem to be sufficient, the protocol's rebinding functionality
   (see section 3.7 of [I-D.ietf-quic-transport]) could be extended to
   allow multiple five-tuples to share a connection ID simultaneously,
   instead of sequentially.]

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.

6.  Security Considerations

   See the security considerations in [I-D.ietf-quic-transport] and
   [I-D.ietf-quic-tls]; the security considerations for the underlying
   transport protocol are relevant for applications using QUIC, as well.

   Application developers should note that any fallback they use when
   QUIC cannot be used due to network blocking of UDP SHOULD guarantee
   the same security properties as QUIC; if this is not possible, the
   connection SHOULD fail to allow the application to explicitly handle
   fallback to a less-secure alternative.  See Section 2.
